   About Us

  <h2>
    Under the dreaming spires of Oxford, amongst the honey sandstone colleges and emerald quads… are thousands of students drowning in stress.

    Enter: Destress. 

    We are three Oxford students who know what it’s like to be soaked in both English drizzle and our own tears, so we’ve created a website to help you destress, and it’s catered especially to the city of Oxford. 

    Isobel: Engineer. Likes to destress by doing yoga in her room and bell-ringing.

    Andreea: Engineer. Romanian. Likes to destress by talking to her parrot.

    Kim: Classicist. Likes to destress by online shopping.
